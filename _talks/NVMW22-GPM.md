This is a workshop presentation of 'GPM' published in ASPLOS '23. This paper explored how to utilise commercially available NVM on a GPU using real hardware. Through this process we came up with a benchmark suite (GPMBench) consisting of GPU applications that benefit from both GPU parallelism as well as NVM persistence. We also provide a GPU-optimised library (libGPM) that simplifies access to NVM from a GPU.
