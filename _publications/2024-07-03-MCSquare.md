excerpt: "In this paper we propose (MC)<sup>2</sup>, a new lazy memory copy mechanism that provides performance improvement to applications that sparsely access the data that they copy. We show that (MC)<sup>2</sup> provides benefits across a variety of microbenchmarks and workloads, including Google's Protobuf, where (MC)<sup>2</sup> provides a 43% speedup and Linux huge page copy-on-write faults, where (MC)<sup>2</sup> provides 250x lower latency."

  (MC)<sup>2</sup> is a lazy memory copy mechanism which can be used within <em>memcpy</em>-like functions to significantly reduce the CPU overhead for copies that are sparsely accessed. It can also hide copy latencies by enhancing the CPU's ability to execute them asynchronously.

  (MC)<sup>2</sup>'s lazy memcpy avoids copying
  data at the time of invocation.  Instead, (MC)<sup>2</sup> tracks
  prospective copies.  If copied data is later accessed by a CPU or the cache, (MC)<sup>2</sup>
  uses the tracking information to lazily execute a copy, when
  necessary. Placing (MC)<sup>2</sup> at the memory controller puts it at the perfect vantage
  point to eliminate the largest source of memcpy overhead---CPU stalls
  due to cache misses in the critical path---while imposing minimal overhead itself.

  (MC)<sup>2</sup> consists of three main components: memory controller extensions that implement
  a lazy memcpy operation, a new instruction exposing
  the lazy memcpy, and a flexible software wrapper with semantics
  identical to memcpy.  We implement and evaluate (MC)<sup>2</sup> in the gem5 simulator using a variety of microbenchmarks and workloads,
  including Google's Protobuf, where (MC)<sup>2</sup> provides a
  43% speedup and Linux huge page copy-on-write faults, where (MC)<sup>2</sup> provides 250$\times$ lower latency.
